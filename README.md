### Hi Visitor ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dylan and I have a BSc in computer science from the University of Victoria.

Iâ€™ve just completed a QA internship at Cambio Earth Systems where I was testing full-stack code for their web application.

My special interests in the field are Quantum Computing and Artificial Intelligence (particularly pertaining to advancing other fields of science). Outside of work I love doing anything in nature, music, games (both tabletop and digital), photography, and much more.
